## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
```
frontend/src/components/
├── MapLayerControl.tsx      # Topographic layer switching
├── RouteManager.tsx         # Main route management hub (tabbed interface)
├── LocationTracker.tsx      # Live GPS tracking & recording
├── GPSIntegration.tsx       # Hardware device connectivity
└── DeviceExport.tsx         # Multi-device export interface
```

### Utility Services
```
frontend/src/utils/
├── deviceExports.ts         # Device-specific format generators
└── gpsDeviceManager.ts      # GPS hardware communication
```

### Data Flow
1. **Route Planning:** User creates routes via map clicks → RouteManager → OpenLayers visualization
2. **Live Tracking:** Geolocation API → LocationTracker → Real-time map updates
3. **Device Export:** Route data → deviceExports utility → Download files
4. **GPS Integration:** Web Serial API → gpsDeviceManager → Device communication

## 🎯 User Interface Features

### Tabbed Interface
The RouteManager now features a clean 3-tab interface:

1. **📍 Planning Tab:**
   - Manual route creation by clicking on map
   - Save/load custom routes
   - Route visualization with waypoints

2. **🧭 Tracking Tab:**
   - Live location tracking controls
   - Real-time recording statistics
   - Start/stop recording functionality
   - Location source indicators (GPS/WiFi/Cell)

3. **📱 Devices Tab:**
   - GPS device connection management
   - Real-time device status
   - Route export to connected devices
   - Data logging and monitoring
